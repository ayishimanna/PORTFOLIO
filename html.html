            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, which includes new features and enhancements such as improved support for multimedia, better semantic elements, and more powerful APIs.</p>
            <p>HTML5 introduces elements like header, footer, article, and section, which help in creating more meaningful and structured web pages. It also provides support for audio, video, and other interactive content directly within the browser, without the need for external plugins.</p>
