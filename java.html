        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language 
           designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
           Created by James Gosling and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems and 
           released in 1995, Java is known for its portability across platforms 
           thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
        <p>Java follows the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), 
            which means that code written in Java can run on any device that has 
            the JVM installed. It is widely used in web development, mobile 
            applications (especially Android apps), enterprise software, and large systems.</p>
