            <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. It is known for its high performance and control over system resources. C++ is widely used in software development for applications requiring high performance, such as game development, real-time systems, and applications that interact directly with hardware.</p>
