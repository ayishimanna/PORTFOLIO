            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall look of web pages. It enables developers to separate content from design, allowing for more flexibility and control over the visual appearance of a website.</p>
        <p>CSS is essential for creating modern, responsive designs. It supports various features like media queries for adaptive layouts, animations for dynamic effects, and custom properties (variables) for reusability and consistency in styling.</p>
